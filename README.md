# A2 Part 2 - Softbody Simulation System

1. Completed. No duplicates ensured and all mesh vertices 
2. Completed. Nested loop so no duplicates. Rest length computed
3. Completed. Initialized correctly.
4. Completed. Ground detection implemented, Penalty springs have correct properties.  
5. Completed. Detach correctly.
6. Completed. Mesh vertexes are updated correcdtly.
7. Completed. Correctly computed and applies force to one and negative force to other for particle-particle spring.
8. Completed. Both functions called in UpdateMesh.
9. Completed. velocity updated first then position.
10. Completed. Correct simulation loop in Update
11. Completed. All cubes have correct properties.
